# blockchainJourney

This repo aims at guiding new comers in their journey to become a blockchain dev, just as I do.

This repo will be updated everytime i find something new to learn and I will list the resources that help you learn it too.

1. What is bitcoin ?
Understanding the way bitcoin works allows understanding the pillars of blockchain.
A very good video can be seen on youtube:

2. What is ETH ?
ETH is based on the same principle as bitcoin except that it adds a layer of functionnalities: smart contracts.
Bitcoin allows transferring coins from an address to another. With ETH, you can now run little programs that rely on the consensus of the blockchain
